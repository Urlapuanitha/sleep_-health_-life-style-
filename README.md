#Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dashboard

The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that
explores the relationship between sleep patterns and lifestyle choices. 
This dashboard provides valuable insights into how various factors, such as diet,
exercise, and demographics, impact sleep quality and overall health. Users can engage
with the data through dynamic visualizations and filters, allowing for in-depth analysis
of trends and correlations. The project is designed to raise awareness about the
importance of healthy lifestyle habits for improving sleep. To view the dashboard, 
simply download the Power BI file (.pbix) from this repository and open it in Power 
BI Desktop. Contributions and suggestions for enhancements are always welcome!
